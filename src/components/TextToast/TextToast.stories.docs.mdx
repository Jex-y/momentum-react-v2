The `<TextToast />` component. This component is designed to retrieve props like the `text` to display and the `textAlignment`, which can be `center` or `left` at the moment.
If no or an empty `text` is passed in, the component will not be rendered. If no `textAlignment` is passed in, the default alignment will be `center`.
